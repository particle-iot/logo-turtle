The Spark Logo Turtle App
=========================

Drive a physical logo turtle with tweets!

Many of us learned as children to draw turtle graphics using the Logo computer language, like this:

    FORWARD 10
    RIGHT 90

At Spark, we wanted to make this happen with our little internet-connected RC car.

This app runs on a server, listening to the twittersphere are parsing out Logo commands to send to the Spark API.

Enjoy!
